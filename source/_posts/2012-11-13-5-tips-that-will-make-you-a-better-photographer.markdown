Every so often, people will make a comment about the photos I take. Usually it's because they turn out so much nicer than theirs do, even using similar equipment, taking shots of the same things. It's really pretty simple. There aren't any formulas, or technical aspects to it--though there is as you want to delve deeper into photography. Here are five tips, that are easy enough to learn, that when applied, will make your photographs so much better.

### 1. See Like a Camera

While this list first, I'd say this is probably the 2nd most important rule. Before we jump into it, lets talk a little about how our sight works. Over thousands of years, our eyesight has evolved into a highly complex system. The brain is such an amazing signal processor, that has adapted, and learned not only during your life time, but throughout the history of man. It's so amazing that If you had special glasses that would make everything you see appear upside down, your brain would automatically correct the image so that what you saw was what you would expect. 

Your eyes see everything, but your brain will filter out and process the information in trillionths of a second. It's constantly throwing away information that it's has learned is just noise. 

Perhaps you can see where this is leading. Your brain filters out information, but your camera doesn't. All of a sudden that great image of you and your family, is marrd by a tree branch. Or that cool statue you photograph looks meh because there is a powerline.

While your brain filters out information when you're looking around in your everyday world, as soon as you look at a photograph, all that information isn't filtered. In general you can't miss things. And once you know something is there, you won't forget. 

Train yourself to see like a camera, and it's easier than it sounds. Once you've composed the shot, give yourself 10 seconds to look around your subject, and the rest of the frame and see if there is anything sticking out. You'd be amazed at how much unwanted things you will catch. As you get better, you'll be able to compose and take the shot without even thinking about it.

### 2. Be Interesting

We naturally find photographs that are interesting, more enjoyable. Boring photographs, are less so. When we see an photograph that looks like we expect, and how we're accustomed to seeing them, it's boring, and we're left feeling like it's we've seen this a thousand times.

Example: When you look at a dog, you're standing up looking down on it, and while it's looking up at you. If you see a photo that mimics this, you automatically think it's uninteresting because this is what a dog looks like to your brain. You're less likely to see a dog from eye level, so when you see a photo taken of a dog at eye level, it's interesting, and you'll be way more likely to think it's a good photo (because it is).

Being interesting might sound tough, but really, think about what you're photographing, and see if you can come up with a unique way to capture it. Sometimes just taking the shot from a different height is enough, but maybe get in close, or get far away. Or maybe turn your camera slightly. Stand in the absolute center, or move off to a far side. 

It's not all just composition either. With the first tip, we talked about how our brain filters out what it believes is noise. Chosing a subject that is "noise" makes for an interesting photograph. For example, a can of coke on a hot day. Thaking a shot that emphasizes the condensation. We see it all the time, and we pay no real attention to it, because unless you're into Newtons Law of Cooling, you probably don't care about the energy conversion that is happening right infront of you.
