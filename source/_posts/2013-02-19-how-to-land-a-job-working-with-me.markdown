## Introduction

Hiring. It's the single most important thing I do for any organization. I was hired for this job, and now I will hire others to work with me. I'd like to talk (not so) breifly about how I evaluate candidates, start to finish. Some of this is really only applicable to those who work in software: PM's, Devs, and Test, however other bits I feel are universal across all industries. 

There is a caveat to this post: Right now, it's very difficult to find talented engineers in Seattle. There are a lot of funded companies doing interesting things, and so good developers have a pick of opportunities. If for some reason, you believe you are a good developer but aren't finding success, then I ask you to consider what I'm going to tell you, because it's probably going to make a difference in finding a job.


### Software vs !Softare

For readers who aren't in the software world, interviewing in the world of software (including Tech-PM, Dev, Test and Dev Manager), is unique among other fields, especially other engineering fields, in that the process is highly technical. We're less likely to be asked to describe time when we did not get along with a manager, and instead asked questions around subject matter expertise, fundamentals of software engineering, as well as to design, and actually write code.

A typical full interview loop consists of 6 to 8 1-hour sessions with different interviewers all asking some sort of question.

Good companies will usuall provide lunch somewhere in the middle. 

## Part 1: My Experiences as a Candidate

I know that I am biased towards my hiring procedures based on my experiences interviewing for developer jobs, and with that in mind, here are some highlights from my formative years as an engineer.

### In the Beginning

For the record, I when I first started, I sucked as a software engineer candidate. Not because I sucked as a developer, but because I lacked the skills to perform adequately in interviews. It wasn't all terribad, I did successfully interview for an internship position, that did require some minimal white-board coding. 

However I must have gotten lucky on the whiteboard, because the next time I was presented with that opportunity I failed miserably. I was interviewing for a full-time position at Expedia. The interviewer and I had a really great report, but then it came to the techincal question. 

> How do you reverse a linked-list?

I did pretty much the worst things you can do as a candidate. I sat there quietly, with a puzzled look on my face, for what seemed like an eternity, afterwhich I said "Uh, I don't know."

The interviewer had this look on his face, like "OH MY GOD THIS GUY IS A MORAN." He tried to be courteous but I could tell he was pissed that I wasted his time.

For my interview at Boeing, I again had a really good report with my interviewer, and was invited for an on-site interview. Boeing is actually highly selective of college-hire engineers, however I did not go through a single coding interview while I was there. That was pretty much an anomoly in my career as an developer candidate. Lucky for me, I was surrounded by some of the smartest engineers in the company, and I was able to learn quite a bit.

### The Middle Years

When I had decided to move back to WA, I had to restart the interviewing process. Again I found myself interviewing with Expedia. I had a phone screen, again great report with the candidate, and this time able to answer the question:

> How do you implement a queue with a stack?

I nailed it, and was invited for an inperson interview. I only goofed during one part of the interview, which involved traversing an array and removing elements from it. I was able to solve the problem, but when the interviewer through in the "curve-ball", I struggled to resolve it. In a random chance, I was also interviewed by the same guy who interviewed me on campus a few years back. He gave me the same question, and I smiled and told him "You actually interviewed me on campus, and asked me this same question, and I did terrible at it, and you got upset because I wasted your time." He kind of smiled, then asked me to solve it again, because apparently he didn't believe me. I nailed the question in 30 seconds, then he gave me a much much harder one, and I was able to solve that as well. He said he was impressed that I was able to solve it, and thanked me for being honest. Ultimately I was rejected, however I feel that it wasn't because of my coding skills, but because I said unintentially said something kind of creepy to the lady who conducted my lunch interview.

For my interview at Clearsight Systems, I was given a series of tasks: a written questionaire, design a parking garage, debug this program, and finally some white board coding. I did well enough on all them to land the job. For the white board coding portion, it felt pretty good when both the interviewers expressed that they felt more than satisfied that I knew what I was talking about. Bam. Got the job. 

When Clearsight started to go under, I interviewed for a position at BioPassword. There I had a mix of success. I remember vividly I was unable to code up an algorithm for Boggle, but I think that because I had come in with a recommendation, I was able to get the job.

### Hitting my Stride

Since then, I've gotten to be pretty good at interviewing. I know I still struggle with completely nailing all white board questions, so I have to really prep for each interview, but I can count on one hand the number of times I've done either a phone screen, or a full-loop in which I was not able to move forward. For my last stint as an employee, I had in my hand 7 job offers, having nailed each interview I did. Some had contacted the evening of the interview, to offer me a job. I've yet to test myself in what I believe is the pinnacle of tough interviews: Google. I'm very confident I would be very successful as an engineer at Google, but I somehow lack the confidence that I would succeed in an interview.


## Part II: On the Other Side

### Step 1: The Resume

I've gotten pretty good at critiqing resumes, especially for developers. The first step in working with me is getting your resume right.

The resume is going to bias me one way or the other. If it sucks, I'll think you suck. If it's okay, I might see potential. If it's stellar, I will be more likely to believe you are stellar.

#### Evaluation

I quickly glance at resumes. I look at education, look at what they are doing currently, I look to see if any achievements stand out, then I check for red-flags.

#### Protip: Lose the objective section.

As a developer, I expect your objective to be:

>"I want to prove that I'm one of the greatest developers on the planet, to work with kick ass people, and make major contributions to your organizations success."

If you tell me otherwise, I will ding you. One time a candidate had on her resume that she wanted to find a position that would allow her to learn HTML5. I passed. I'm sure she has a busy life outside of work, and yes it's way easier to learn technology one the job. However, if you want to learn HTML5, why don't you just do it? Take a course, buy a book, whatever, software development is a field where the start-up costs are pretty much nil. I put much more stock in candidates who put in effort outside of their job to learn new technologies, because hopefully they can bring some of that learning to our team.

#### Protip: Be Achievement Oriented

Instead of the "What did I do for company XYZZY?" tell me what the results of your work were. 

> Increased the ratings of our iOS app from 2.5 stars to 4.5 stars.

It took me quite a long while to start thinking of achievements, instead of daily-responsibilities, and even longer to actually get some impressive achievements under mybelt. Make me aware of how much value you bring to an organization. Now, most people still don't do this, so I have to often ask candidates to explain this. Also they may opt instead to put that information in the coverletter.

#### Protip: Keep it simple

I groan everytime I see a 3+ page resume. Seriously, I don't give a shit what you did 5 years ago, unless it was invent Facebook. Seriously, 1 page, 2 if you're bad ass.

#### Protip: Mind your history

If your resume is littered with stints of less than 1 year at various companies, that is a red-flag. Perhaps that person hasn't yet found the right company, or perhaps they're just not a good fit anywhere.

If you've been laid off, hopefully there was a good reason. I've never been laid off, been through many many rounds of layoffs, and I consider myself only an above average engineer.

If there are gaps in your resume, please fill them with meaningful work. Start a side project, go back to school, do an online cert, whatever.

#### Contract vs Full Time

If this is for a full-time position, and you've only worked as a contractor, I wonder if you'll enjoye working as a full-time person for very long. There is nothing wrong with contract work; it offers the greatest amount of flexibility, freedom, and ability to pick and choose your projects, and for a lot of people there is a certain allure to that. There is also the allure of ultimately not giving a shit about the client company. You're paid to do a job, and you're going to do a good job (hopefully), or at least do what they ask. As a full time hire, we need you to be more than just a developer. We need you to help steer the ship in case of trouble waters, to help bail if we take on water, and possibly rebuild the ship if necessary. There is more responsibility as a full-time person, and I need to know you're ready for that.

#### Education

Education is a hot-button issue for hiring. I'm of the opinion that education is important, but if you lack a formal degree, you hopefully have a good reason. Right off the bat, if I see someone with other than an engineering, CS or math degree, I have concern about where the learned the very basics of development. I won't reject them outright, but I will need to see where they fall in basic understanding of computer science. Certainly not having a super strong grasp isn't a show stopper, but not having rudimentary understanding of the basics is.

I also won't bias against schools, but I will bias up schools like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford, etc. I'll still need to verify you are awesome, but I will probably have a higher opinion of you when we start this process.

### Step 2: Applying for a positon

This is straight forward. If I ask you for:

1. Your Resume
1. A paragraph about yourself
1. Link to your Github account
1. Link to portfolio work

Please send me all these things, when applying. Otherwise I will assume you didn't bother to read my posting, and just copy and pasted your response.

I suck at writing coverletters, so unless it's really bad, or really exceptional, I don't put too much stock into it.

### Step 3: Phone Screen

So you've made it past my resume filters, and I want to talk with you. Sweet!

First we'll do a quick fit-screen. Really if you have a pulse, can talk intelligbly about something, and show some sort of passion, you'll pass this part.

Next is the tech phone screen. Usually I use this part to assess if your resume is bullshit. Suprisingly I know quite a bit about a lot of software subjects, so I can usually ask intelligent questions, and I expect intelligent responses. I say suprisingly, because I've gotten a lot of comments over the years about how I know those things (#humblebrag). Then if I'm feeling good about those answers, I'll as a technical question, like

> Implement a queue with a stack

Unfortunately there have been a few occassions where I felt satisified with the resume answers, but did not continue with the technical questions, due to not being able to fully understand a candidate. There are talented developers out there, for whom, english is a 2nd, 3rd, or 1337th language. However given the size of our team, and what *we* need to do, oral communication skills are paramount. 

### Step 4: The Full Loop

And so we've come full-circle. You have a good resume, you did well during the phone screens, so now it's time to bring you in for a full-loop. 

Because we're a small team, you actually will have a couple non-technical interviews, but by and large the bulk of your time is spent with me answering questions on a white board.

In our time together I assess several things:

1. Can you code?
1. What is your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and other CS topics?
1. How do you approach error handling and testing?
1. Design, Collaboration, and Leadership

As well as how you attack problem solving, how do you communicate, how do you ask for help, how do you think, etc.

#### Can you code?

As others have written before, the only real way to see if a candidate can code, is to have them code, and to observe them code.

I like to ask a pretty simple question to get things started. If the question is super simple, like Fizzbuzz, I expect you code it as close to syntatically correct as possible, in whatever language you prefer. If its slightly harder, I will forgo the syntax requirement and focus more on the coding solution. Regardless, the algorithm is simple, and yet most people struggle here. With this, and questions, I try to steer the candidate into the right direction. If they're going to an obvious pitfall, I might ask them to justify why they chose to do what they do.

##### Protip: If you vocalize your decisions before hand, I'll help steer you to the right solution

#### What is your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and other CS topics?

From the simple solution, I then start asking harder and harder questions. Again helping the candidate reach the right solution. This is where you find out what the candidate knows. I expect a basic level of understanding for data structures:

1. Linked Lists
1. Hash-Tables
1. Arrays

And when to use each.

I also may probe things like recursive algorithms, inheritance, polymorphism, and class design as well. 

#### How do you approach error handling and testing?

Undoubtedly, a candidate might make a mistake when writing up a solution. I use that as an opportunity to talk about error handling and testing. If the candidate is really good, it's often that they didn't cover for a  cases like bad inputs, but more often than not there is a logic error. We'll walk through testing the program and debuggin and fixing errors. 

#### Design, Collaboration, and Leadership

This is where I'd like candidates to have fun, shine and let their personalities show. I pick something that I'm interested in, or have worked on recently, and we role play it out.

> First, pretend I'm your nit-wit boss, and I've asked you to design and build a mobile analytics platform. I'm stupid, so I don't know what one is, what it does, but I know I need it. Okay, great. Now pretend I'm also a subordinate, and you have to explain your design decisions to. Also to help, I can also be someone you can bounce ideas off of.

Usually at this point, we should have a good report going. The point of this exercise is to see how we work together, how you lead the discussion, and really how well you understand the components of an end to end system. Hopefully this pulls together your past experience and knowledge of different facets of software development.

 I don't expect candidates to be experts here, but I do expect some familiarty with building a simple web-app.
