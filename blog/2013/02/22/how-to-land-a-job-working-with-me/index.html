<div class="entry-content"><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hiring. It&#8217;s the single most important thing I do for any organization. I was hired for this job, and now I will hire others to work with me. I&#8217;d like to talk (not so) briefly about how I evaluate candidates, start to finish. Some of this is really only applicable to those who work in software: PM&#8217;s, Devs, and Test, however other bits I feel are universal across all industries.</p>

<h4>Caveat 1</h4>

<p>Right now, it&#8217;s very difficult to find talented engineers in Seattle. There are a lot of funded companies doing interesting things, and so good developers have a pick of opportunities. If for some reason, you believe you are a good developer but aren&#8217;t finding success, then I ask you to consider what I&#8217;m going to tell you, because it&#8217;s probably going to make a difference in finding a job.</p>

<h4>Caveat 2</h4>

<p>If you&#8217;ve gone through this process, and were not extended an offer, all it really means was that you weren&#8217;t the right fit for our engineering position. I&#8217;ve been rejected for one opportunity, hired for others and have found success. It isn&#8217;t necessarily about winning here, it&#8217;s about taking shots.</p>

<h4>Software vs !Softare</h4>

<p>For readers who aren&#8217;t in the software world, interviewing in the world of software (including Tech-PM, Dev, Test and Dev Manager), is unique among other fields, especially other engineering fields, in that the process is highly technical. We&#8217;re less likely to be asked to describe a time when we did not get along with a manager, and instead, asked questions around subject matter expertise, fundamentals of software engineering, as well as to design and actually write code.</p>

<p>A typical full interview loop consists of 6 to 8, 1-hour sessions with different interviewers all asking some sort of question.</p>

<p>Good companies will usually provide lunch somewhere in the middle.</p>

<h2>Part 1: My Experiences as a Candidate</h2>

<p>I know that I am biased towards my hiring procedures based on my experiences interviewing for developer jobs, and with that in mind, here are some highlights from my formative years as an engineer.</p>

<h3>In the Beginning</h3>

<p>For the record, when I first started, I sucked as a software engineer candidate. Not because I sucked as a developer, but because I lacked the skills to perform adequately in interviews. It wasn&#8217;t all terribad, I did successfully interview for an internship position, that did require some minimal white-board coding.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However I must have gotten lucky on the whiteboard, because the next time I was presented with that opportunity I failed miserably. I was interviewing for a full-time position at Expedia. The interviewer and I had a really great rapport, but then it came to the technical question.</p>

<blockquote><p>How do you reverse a linked-list?</p></blockquote>

<p>I did pretty much the worst things you can do as a candidate. I sat there quietly, with a puzzled look on my face, for what seemed like an eternity, after which I said &#8220;Uh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interviewer had this look on his face, like &#8220;DUMBASS.&#8221; He tried to be courteous but I could tell he was pissed that I wasted his time.</p>

<p>Next, for my interview at Boeing, I again had a really good rapport with my interviewer, and was invited for an on-site interview. Boeing is actually highly selective of college-hire engineers, though I actually did not go through a single coding interview while I was there. That was pretty much an anomaly in my career as an developer candidate. I count myself pretty lucky for my Boeing gig, because I was exposed to a lot of different technologies, thrown into the deep end and surrounded by some very seriously talented engineers, making it an excellent learning experience.</p>

<h3>The Middle Years</h3>

<p>When I had decided to move back to WA, I had to restart the interviewing process. Again I found myself interviewing with Expedia. I had a phone screen, again great rapport with the interviewer, and this time able to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote><p>How do you implement a queue with a stack?</p></blockquote>

<p>I nailed it, and was invited for an in person interview. I only goofed during one part of the interview, which involved traversing an array and removing elements from it. I was able to solve the problem, but when the interviewer through in the &#8220;curve-ball&#8221;, I struggled to resolve it. Still, I felt that I had talked intelligently enough about my process that I got a &#8220;Hire&#8221; vote from the guy.</p>

<p>In a random chance, I was also interviewed by the same guy who interviewed me on campus a few years back. He gave me the same question, and I smiled and told him &#8220;You actually interviewed me on campus, and asked me this same question, and I did terrible at it, and you got upset because I wasted your time.&#8221; He kind of smiled, then asked me to solve it again, because apparently he didn&#8217;t believe me. I nailed the question in 30 seconds, then he gave me a much much harder one, and I was able to solve that as well. He said he was impressed that I was able to solve it, and thanked me for being honest.</p>

<p>Sadly, in the end I was rejected. I felt that I had done well enough: solved technical problems, great rapport with most of the interviewers, and generally showed my potential as an up and coming engineer powerhouse. I said most of the interviewers, because I said unintentionally said something hella creepy to the lady who conducted my lunch interview.</p>

<p>For my interview at Clearsight Systems, I was given a series of tasks: a written questionnaire, design a parking garage, debug this program, and finally some white board coding. I did well enough on all them to land the job. For the white board coding portion, it felt pretty good when both the interviewers expressed that they felt more than satisfied that I knew what I was talking about. Bam. Got the job.</p>

<p>When Clearsight started to go under, I interviewed for a position at BioPassword. There, I had a mix of success. I remember vividly I was unable to code up an algorithm for Boggle, but I think that because I had come in with a recommendation, I was able to get the job. I knew I had done well enough because I was asked to interview with the CEO of the company. Usually when you talk to the CEO, it&#8217;s a great sign that the company is interested in you.</p>

<h3>Hitting my Stride</h3>

<p>These days, I&#8217;ve gotten to be pretty good at interviewing. I know I still struggle with completely nailing all white board questions, so I have to really prep for each interview, but I can count on one hand the number of times I&#8217;ve done either a phone screen, or a full-loop in which I was not able to move forward.</p>

<p>For my last stint as an employee, I had in my hand 7 job offers, having nailed each interview I did. Some had contacted me the evening of the interview, to offer me a job. I&#8217;ve yet to test myself in what I believe is the pinnacle of tough interviews: Google, but I would say that though I&#8217;m very confident I would be very successful as an engineer at Google, I really feel like I wouldn&#8217;t succeed passing the interview.</p>

<h2>Part II: On the Other Side</h2>

<p>So you want to come work with us. How do you make that happen?</p>

<h3>Step 1: The Resume</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten pretty good at critiquing resumes, especially for developers. The first step in working with me is getting your resume right.</p>

<p>The resume is going to bias me one way or the other. If it sucks, I&#8217;ll think you suck. If it&#8217;s okay, I might see potential. If it&#8217;s stellar, I will be more likely to believe you are stellar.</p>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

<p>I quickly glance at resumes. I look at education, look at what they are doing currently, I look to see if any achievements stand out, then I check for red-flags.</p>

<h4>Protip: Lose the objective section.</h4>

<p>As a developer, I expect your objective to be:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m one of the greatest developers on the planet, and I wanna work with kick ass people, and make major contributions to your organizations success. Hire me, and I&#8217;ll prove it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you tell me otherwise, I will ding you. One time a candidate had on her resume that she wanted to find a position that would allow her to learn HTML5. I passed. I&#8217;m sure she has a busy life outside of work, and yes it&#8217;s way easier to learn technology on the job. However, if you want to learn HTML5, why don&#8217;t you just do it? Take a course, buy a book, whatever, software development is a field where the start-up costs are pretty much nil. I put much more stock in candidates who put in effort outside of their job to learn new technologies, because hopefully they can bring some of that learning to our team.</p>

<h4>Protip: Be Achievement Oriented</h4>

<p>Instead of the &#8220;What did I do for company XYZZY?&#8221; tell me what the results of your work were.</p>

<blockquote><p>Increased the ratings of our iOS app from 2.5 stars, to 3.5 stars. In. My. First. Release. Eventually I increased the rating from 2.5 to 4.5 stars.</p></blockquote>

<p>It took me quite a long while to start thinking of achievements, instead of daily-responsibilities, and even longer to actually get some impressive achievements under my belt. Make me aware of how much value you bring to an organization. Now, most people still don&#8217;t do this, so if you do, you will put yourself ahead of the pack.</p>

<h4>Protip: Keep it simple</h4>

<p>I groan every time I see a 3+ page resume. Seriously, I don&#8217;t give a shit what you did 5 years ago, let alone 10, unless it was invent Facebook. Seriously, 1 page. 2 if you&#8217;re bad ass</p>

<h4>Protip: Mind your history</h4>

<p>If your resume is littered with stints of less than 1 year at various companies, that is a red-flag. Perhaps that person hasn&#8217;t yet found the right company, or perhaps they&#8217;re just not a good fit anywhere.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been laid off. I&#8217;ve survived through many many rounds of layoffs, and I consider myself only an above average engineer. If you&#8217;ve been laid off, hopefully there was a good reason.</p>

<p>If there are gaps in your resume, please fill them with meaningful work. Start a side project, go back to school, do an on-line cert, whatever. Just do something other than sit around.</p>

<h4>Contract vs Full Time</h4>

<p>If this is for a full-time position, and you&#8217;ve only worked as a contractor, I wonder if you&#8217;ll enjoy working as a full-time person for very long. There is nothing wrong with contract work; it offers the greatest amount of flexibility, freedom, and ability to pick and choose your projects, and for a lot of people there is a certain allure to that. There is also the allure of ultimately not giving a shit about the client company. You&#8217;re paid to do a job, and you&#8217;re going to do a good job (hopefully), or at least do what they ask. As a full time hire, we need you to be more than just a developer. We need you to help steer the ship in case of trouble waters, to help bail if we take on water, and possibly rebuild the ship if necessary. There is more responsibility as a full-time person, and I need to know you&#8217;re ready for that.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>Education is a hot-button issue for hiring. I&#8217;m of the opinion that education is important, but if you lack a formal degree, you hopefully have a good reason. Right off the bat, if I see someone with other than an engineering, CS or math degree, I have concern about where the learned the very basics of development. I won&#8217;t reject them outright, but I will need to see where they fall in basic understanding of computer science. Certainly not having a super strong grasp isn&#8217;t a show stopper, but not having rudimentary understanding of the basics is.</p>

<p>I also won&#8217;t bias against schools, but I will bias up schools like MIT, Harvard, and Stanford, etc. I&#8217;ll still need to verify you are awesome, but I will probably have a higher opinion of you when we start this process.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Applying for a position</h3>

<p>This is straight forward. If I ask you for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your Resume</li>
<li>A paragraph about yourself</li>
<li>Link to your Github account</li>
<li>Link to portfolio work</li>
</ol>


<p>Please send me all these things, when applying. Otherwise I will assume you didn&#8217;t bother to read my posting, and just copy and pasted your response. If you won&#8217;t put effort into applying to work with me, I&#8217;ll just assume you won&#8217;t apply effort when you actually do. That&#8217;s probably an unfair, but so is life.</p>

<p>Since I suck at writing cover letters, so unless it&#8217;s really bad, or really exceptional, I won&#8217;t make too much out of one.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Phone Screen</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made it past my resume filters, and I want to talk with you. Sweet!</p>

<p>First we&#8217;ll do a quick fit-screen. Really if you have a pulse, can talk intelligibly about something, and show some sort of passion, you&#8217;ll pass this part.</p>

<p>Next is the tech phone screen. Usually I use this part to assess if your resume is bullshit. Surprisingly I know quite a bit about a lot of software subjects, so I can usually ask intelligent questions, and I expect intelligent responses. I say surprisingly, because I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of comments over the years about how I know those things (#humblebrag). Then if I&#8217;m feeling good about those answers, I&#8217;ll as a technical question, like (sound familiar?)</p>

<blockquote><p>Implement a queue with a stack</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately there have been a few occasions where I felt satisfied with the resume answers, but did not continue with the technical questions, due to not being able to fully understand a candidate. There are talented developers out there, for whom, English is a 2nd, 3rd, or 1337th language. However given the size of our team, and what <em>we</em> need to do, oral communication skills are paramount. If English is not your strong suit, I recommend finding a speech coach and working through it.</p>

<h3>Step 4: The Full Loop</h3>

<p>And so we&#8217;ve come full-circle. You have a good resume, you did well during the phone screens, so now it&#8217;s time to bring you in for a full-loop.</p>

<p>Because we&#8217;re a small team, you actually will have a couple non-technical interviews, but by and large the bulk of your time is spent with me answering questions on a white board.</p>

<p>In our time together I assess several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can you code?</li>
<li>How do you solve problems?</li>
<li>What is your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and other CS topics?</li>
<li>How do you approach error handling and testing?</li>
<li>Design, Collaboration, and Leadership</li>
</ol>


<p>As well as how you attack problem solving, how do you communicate, how do you ask for help, how do you think, etc.</p>

<h4>Can you code?</h4>

<p>As others have written before, the only real way to see if a candidate can code, is to have them code, and to observe them doing it.</p>

<p>I like to ask a pretty simple question to get things started. If the question is super simple, like Fizzbuzz, I expect you code it as close to syntactically correct as possible, in whatever language you prefer. If its slightly harder, I will forgo the syntax requirement and focus more on the coding solution. Regardless, the algorithm is simple, and yet most people struggle here. With this, and questions, I try to steer the candidate into the right direction. If they&#8217;re going to an obvious pitfall, I might ask them to justify why they chose to do what they do.</p>

<h5>Protip: If you vocalize your decisions before hand, I&#8217;ll help steer you to the right solution</h5>

<p>In engineering classes, we would be graded less on the right answer, and more on the process. If you show you work, and how you arrived to your solution, you would be given enough credit to pass the assignment, regardless of the solution. That holds true here. If you show me how you think, I&#8217;ll show you how we work together to solve a problem.</p>

<h4>How do you approach problem solving?</h4>

<p>Engineering in a nutshell is about taking big problems and breaking them up into smaller problems, and applying learned knowledge to solve these smaller problems. Software engineering is no different. I&#8217;m not too much of a stickler on how people approach problem solving, but there are a few red flags that stick out.</p>

<h5>Being Quiet</h5>

<p>I prefer working with people whom I can bounce ideas off of. If you are a quiet thinker, that might work for other organizations, but not for me. Tell me what you are thinking.</p>

<h5>Premature Optimization</h5>

<p>This is usually a learned skill. If you are senior, I expect you to know this.</p>

<h5>Overly Complex Solutions</h5>

<p>I&#8217;m not too bright, so the chances of me asking you to come up with a successor to PageRank is unlikely. No PhD dissertations please.</p>

<h5>Douche Baggery</h5>

<p>Look, white board coding isn&#8217;t the most fun, and there are people who struggle with it, yet are very good developers. Still, as engineers, we&#8217;ve all gone through this shared pain, so bitching about it, being argumentative, and acting like a dickhead isn&#8217;t going to win you any points. I asked one candidate if he wanted some more water before we got started, and he smugly held up his glass and pointed at it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, dumbass, I see your glass has water in it. I asked if you wanted <em>MORE</em> fucking water.</p></blockquote>

<p>You guessed it. No-Hire (his solutions were also shitty)</p>

<h4>What is your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and other CS topics?</h4>

<p>From the simple solution, I then start asking harder and harder questions. Again helping the candidate reach the right solution. This is where you find out what the candidate knows. I expect a basic level of understanding for data structures:</p>

<ol>
<li>Linked Lists</li>
<li>Hash-Tables</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ol>


<p>And when to use each.</p>

<p>I also may probe things like recursive algorithms, synchronization, inheritance, polymorphism, and class design as well. The idea is that you know these fundamentals. If your resume shows that you jumped into CS from a different discipline or lack a formal education, then I will really hit fundamentals, as having a good grasp is usually the challenge that non-CS degreed developers tend to face.</p>

<h4>How do you approach error handling and testing?</h4>

<p>Undoubtedly, a candidate might make a mistake when writing up a solution. I use that as an opportunity to talk about error handling and testing. If the candidate is really good, it&#8217;s often that they didn&#8217;t cover for cases like bad inputs, but more often than not there is a logic error. We&#8217;ll walk through testing the program and debugging and fixing errors. Since we&#8217;re on a white board, the debugging process is slower, but the idea is to see how quickly they pick up on issues.</p>

<h5>Protip: Run a few examples through your code</h5>

<p>It looks good to me, if you take an opportunity to test your solution out.</p>

<h4>Design, Collaboration, and Leadership</h4>

<p>This is where I&#8217;d like candidates to have fun, shine and let their personalities show. I pick something that I&#8217;m interested in, or have worked on recently, and we role play it out.</p>

<blockquote><p>First, pretend I&#8217;m your nit-wit boss, and I&#8217;ve asked you to design and build a mobile analytics platform. I&#8217;m stupid, so I don&#8217;t know what one is, what it does, but I know I need it. Okay, great. Now pretend I&#8217;m also a subordinate, and you have to explain your design decisions to. Also to help, I can also be someone you can bounce ideas off of and ask questions of.</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually at this point, we should have a good rapport going. The point of this exercise is to see how we work together, how you lead the discussion, and really how well you understand the components of an end to end system. Hopefully this pulls together your past experience and knowledge of different facets of software development.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t expect candidates to be experts here, but I do expect familiarity with building a web-app, including database, redundancy, load balancing, web servers and how they all play together.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, this is your chance to outshine and really drive home why you are the right candidate for this position. There really aren&#8217;t any tips for this section. Either you&#8217;re our boy Blue, or you&#8217;re not. Give it your best.</p>

<h3>Step 5: The Working Session</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made it through the full loop, we&#8217;ll ask you to come back and work with us in a real working session. We&#8217;ll pick a problem that we&#8217;re currently facing, and all of us will work to solve it. This is as much for you to see us, as it us to see you. It&#8217;s similar to the last part of my 1:1 interview, but now includes the entire team, and a real actual issue we&#8217;re facing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen some candidates not do well here, and it&#8217;s less about skill, and typically been more about fit to role. Specifically once you&#8217;ve passed the technical portion, we know you&#8217;re a capable developer. What we need to assess is what impact you will make in our organization. The higher the multiplicative impact, the better you look. We want to see how passionate you are about wanting to work with us. This is our lives, our skin in the game, and I want everyone who is going to join us, to want to be a part of that.</p>

<h2>Outroduction</h2>

<p>While people may struggle with certain areas of interviewing with us, if you have passion, you show that you genuinely want to work with us, have smarts, are capable of learning, and get shit done attitude, you&#8217;ll do well here, and pretty much any other organization you interview with. Even though software interviews are highly technical, these soft skills end up minimizing your deficiencies and instead highlight your better qualities.</p>

<p>Interviewing is a skill. It takes practice to get good at it. Hopefully when you interview, even if you don&#8217;t get the job, you feel that the process felt fair, and that you had every opportunity to do your best.</p>
